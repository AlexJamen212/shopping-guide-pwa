# Production Server Setup - VERIFIED ✅

## Server Configuration
- **Command Used**: `npm run preview` (Vite production preview)
- **Server URL**: http://localhost:4173
- **Source**: dist/ folder (production build)
- **Status**: Successfully serving production build

## App Load Verification
- ✅ App loads successfully at http://localhost:4173
- ✅ Page title: "Shopping Guide"

## Console Analysis
### ✅ Critical Systems Working:
- Service Worker registered successfully
- App loads and renders correctly
- No JavaScript errors preventing functionality

### ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-blocking):
- Missing favicon (vite.svg) - cosmetic only
- Missing PWA icon (pwa-192x192.png) - doesn't affect core functionality
- Preload warning - performance optimization, not functionality blocker

## Production Build Confirmation
- ✅ Serving from dist/ folder (not src/)
- ✅ Compiled production assets loading
- ✅ App is accessible and functional
- ✅ Ready for offline functionality testing

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with:
1. Offline core functionality testing
2. Network independence validation
3. Service worker verification
4. Data persistence testing

**Status**: PRODUCTION SERVER READY FOR TESTING
